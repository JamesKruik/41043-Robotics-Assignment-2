3rd May 2021 Workflow goals

- Produce code for safety in demo portion of assignment
	--> make the robot retreat from a simulated safety symbol
	--> utilising visual servoing and RMRC
	--> use of AR tags to set as an obstacle to avoid impact, must use trajectory to move 
	    around the tage or simply retrun back to home state to illutrate avoidance.


- Bonus
	--> having system react to real or simulated RGB-D sensor data.
	--> calibration, mapping, object orientation, image processing
	--> will focus on the single RGB camera for object recognition
	--> setup Kinect camera as a secondary to identify environment calibration
	    first
	-->if possible use the Kinect for image processing for the end effector.
